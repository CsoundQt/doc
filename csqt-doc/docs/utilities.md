The *Utilities* button gives acces to some of the major Csound Utilities. On the right side, you find the relevant page of the Csound Manual, which describes the usage and the parameters. On the left side, you find the default settings, which can be changed by typing and/or browsing input or output files. The *Run ...* button executes the utility with the current settings.
