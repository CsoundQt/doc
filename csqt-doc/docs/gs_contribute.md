# Contribute

CsoundQt exists because some musicians and programmers engage for it. We (AndrÃ©s. Tarmo, Eduardo, Joachim, Eugenio and many others) do it as we want to use a tool which is our common property. Everyone is invited to use it, too: Without any fee or restriction.

We welcome and need contributions from you, the users of this software. These contributions can be very different. Here are some typical cases:

## Did you find a bug?

Tell us what is not working. For this, we need some information:

- What are you doing? Try to explain step by step so that we can reproduce this error.  
- What is the expected behaviour, and what is happening instead?  
- Which version of CsoundQt and which version of Csound do you use?
- What is your operating system, and which version?

To give an example:

   > *When I select the Hello World example from Examples > CsoundQt > Getting Started > Basics, and press the Run button, I do not hear any sound. I use CsoundQt 1.1.3 and Csound 6.18. I am on Windows 11.*
   
The best place for bug reports is the to file a ticket in the [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/issues). What you need to do for it is to sign in at Github.

the second best place is to send an email at the [CsoundQt User Mailing List](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qutecsound/lists/qutecsound-users). After subscribing, you can send a email at the list.
